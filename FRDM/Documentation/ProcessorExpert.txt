Module "WAIT1"     (component Wait)
   - WAIT1_Wait10Cycles -Wait for 10 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_Wait100Cycles -Wait for 100 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_WaitCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (16bit data type).
   - WAIT1_WaitLongCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (32bit data type).
   - WAIT1_Waitms -Wait for a specified time in milliseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitus -Wait for a specified time in microseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.

Module "CS1"       (component CriticalSection)
   - CS1_CriticalVariable -Defines a variable if necessary. This is a macro.
   - CS1_EnterCritical -Enters a critical section
   - CS1_ExitCritical -Exits a critical section

Module "LED1"      (component LED)
   - LED1_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.
   - LED1_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LED1_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LED1_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LED1_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LED1_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LED1_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LED1_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.

Module "LED2"      (component LED)
   - LED2_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.
   - LED2_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LED2_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LED2_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LED2_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LED2_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LED2_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LED2_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.

Module "LED3"      (component LED)
   - LED3_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.
   - LED3_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LED3_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LED3_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LED3_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LED3_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LED3_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LED3_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL25Z128LK4)
